A Privacy first, open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration.

Logseq is hugely inspired by Rome Research, org-mode, Tidwiki, Workfloly, and Cuekeeper. So, it's possible to use markdown and org-more also you can back up your notes to git directly from the app through auto commit which is amazing. You can install community themes and extensions as you do in obsidian but since it's still in beta and does not have a vast community yet therefore plugins are limited.

##### What I Prefer?

I use bundled notes for quick note-taking and obsidian for organized ones. I tried Simplenote and Standard Notes which were way simple to my needs but bundled notes UI/UX top notch and its web clipping feature is the second main reason to settle on it. Since I use it for quick notes, therefore, I don't worry about privacy much obsidian in the other hand keep notes offline but I still believe nothing can beat open source in terms of privacy.
